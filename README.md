# odin-landing-page
Welp, another small project done. I feel like this one had a lots of duct tape used... but hey! It looks close to original, right? [here's example](img/image.png) I mean it's not like someone will look underneath the hood.. hey! DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!... as I was saying... yeah the landing page, looks decent, from afar.. and when you squint your eyes.

hey man idk what to tell you, trying my best lol
